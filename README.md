To add a new cell, you have to click the top half of the screen and then write something, and only after that you need to click the "Add your dream" button. If you want to delete a cell, you can drag the selected cell from the trail to the leading yaks. But if you need to edit your dream, you must perform opposing actions: swipe your finger from left to right, and a pop-up window will appear on almost the entire screen. You can edit your dream and then press the green button to save the editions or go out by touching red one.
